	The electrical grid in the United States cannot continue to meet the ever-increasing economic, electrical, and environmental demands as it is dated. Its inability to handle natural disasters, and even minor incidents, can lead to millions of families being impacted. Therefore, action must be taken to improve its resilience and reliability. This paper aims to find the most cost-effective, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable way to enhance a grid by examining three solutions: adopting the smart grid, implementing solar photovoltaics with battery storage, or combining both approaches, using NGCC as the baseline. Similar trends were found using Austin, Texas, and Sammamish, Washington, as case studies. A key takeaway is that no single solution excelled in all areas; instead, different options demonstrated strengths in specific aspects, such as cost, energy efficiency, or environmental impact. For construction and yearly operation and maintenance costs, NGCC was the best option, and for annual residential bills, the smart grid was the least expensive. The smart grid also proved to be the most energy-efficient solution. Solar photovoltaics with battery storage integrated within a smart grid was the most environmentally friendly option, offering the lowest annual carbon footprint.
